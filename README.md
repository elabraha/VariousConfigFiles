# Dotfiles
My many config files I wanted to place on github to save them for some reason.
Some config files for configurations I want to save. Others are too complicated. I might have to buy sublime for instance. I wish it was easier to save all of my packages.
Maybe some can be saved with purchase or linked accounts or something. The way nvim and tmux configurations are done you can just use the config files to set it up again with the exception of downloading all the fonts again.
